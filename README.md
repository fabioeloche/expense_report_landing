## Project Overview
The N2F Expense Report Website serves as a hub for businesses to learn about the platform’s key features and quickly sign up for a trial. N2F enables companies to save time and resources by automating the process of tracking expenses, generating corporate cards, and integrating with existing accounting software. The website is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, allowing users to easily access the information they need on any device.

## Design

### Color Scheme
The website uses a sleek black background with white text, providing a clean and professional look. Orange and yellow gradients are used to highlight buttons and headers, adding visual emphasis to important calls-to-action, such as the sign-up button.

### Typography
The website uses two fonts from Google Fonts:
- **Oswald** for headings, providing a bold and modern look.
- **Lato** for body text, ensuring readability across different screen sizes and devices.

### Layout
The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The grid system allows content to be displayed clearly, with enough space for users to navigate the site effortlessly.

## Features

### Key Features
- **Responsive Hero Video:** The homepage features a full-screen video that plays automatically, providing an immediate visual representation of the N2F platform. It engages users from the start and includes a prominent call-to-action for signing up.
- **Receipt Scanning:** Users can scan receipts in under 5 seconds using N2F’s built-in AI-powered OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. This feature is central to the platform and saves businesses valuable time.
- **Corporate Card Integration:** N2F allows companies to issue corporate cards to employees, which can be used for expense tracking and reporting. The integration of these cards into the platform ensures that all expenses are accounted for automatically.
- **Seamless Software Integration:** N2F integrates directly with a company’s accounting and payroll software, allowing for a smooth transfer of data and reducing the need for manual entry.

### User Journey
The website is designed to guide users through a seamless journey:
- **Homepage:** Visitors are welcomed with an engaging hero video and clear messaging about the platform’s key benefits. A prominent "Sign Up" button encourages users to start their free trial.
- **Features Page:** The features are outlined in detail, with easy-to-understand descriptions of each. This page focuses on the time and cost savings offered by N2F and the ease of integrating it with existing systems.
- **Sign-Up Page:** The sign-up process is kept simple, with a form that asks for basic details such as the user’s first name, last name, and email address. The goal is to reduce friction and make it easy for potential users to get started.
- **Footer:** Available on every page, the footer provides links to N2F’s social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) for further engagement.

## Code Structure Explanation

### Header
The header section of the site includes the logo and navigation menu. The navigation menu contains links to the Home, Features, and Sign-Up pages.
